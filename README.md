# DA395A-Projekt
Final project for course DA395A. 

Georg Grankvist & Paul Moustakas 

IMDB Top250 watchlist application, built using React JS and the IMDB-API. 
Fetches a random movie from the top 250 list on IMDB, displays its title, ranking, rating and poster image. Users can then save the movie to a watchlist,
stored locally in the users browser. 

The usage of React wasn't motivated by technical aspects, but rather a previous slight familiarity with the framework and a desire to explore it further and learn. 
Besides that, as we have understood React is the most popular JS framework and there is a high demand in the industry for web developers who know it, which we saw as an
additional motivation for learning it. However, in hindsight we who have a primary background in Java and OOP might (very little previous JS experience) have benefitted 
from picking Angular as it builds on many familiar concepts such as OOP, dependency injection and MVC which might have lowered the learning curve. Vue would have perhaps
suited us well, as it apparently is a bit simpler to pick up and learn than the other two when one does not have much JS experience. Picking React also allowed us to use 
the third-party React library Chakra UI to build our interface, which we also wanted to try.
